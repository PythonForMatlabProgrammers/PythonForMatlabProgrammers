If you have read this far, you must be interested in Python. There's
more to learn, of course, but if you have absorbed the concepts you've
just read about, you are already functional with the Python language.

If you did not perform the installations and code snippet executions
provided throughout this article, a good next step would be to read
through the article again, performing all of the installations and
examples. When we first mentioned IDEs (back on page 3) we mentioned
that you should perhaps wait to choose an IDE. But now's the time. If
you want to put together your own Python computing environment, you can
download Python, the packages you need, and the IDE of your choice.
Alternatively, you can skip all of that and just download Anaconda.

Two documents are particularly important for your continued study. The
[Python Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
will tell you about the functions in the Python Standard Library. We've
touched on many functions in this article, but the Library Reference is
the definitive guide. Secondly, the [Python Language
Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) is a
comprehensive document that will tell you everything about the
language's design, syntax and semantics.

You absolutely should visit the [Python Software
Foundation](https://www.python.org/) home page. From there you can find
the above two documents, tutorials, how-to guides, code examples,
installation guides and much more.

And if you are more of a book reader, you'll find numerous ones in
bookstores about performing data science in Python. One that we
recommend is O'Reilly's [Python for Data
Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do), written by
Wes McKinney, creator of the Pandas library. This is an incredibly
well-written and thorough book, an enjoyable read. You can purchase a
digital version and then cut-and-paste examples from the book into your
Python interpreter. Or better, you can follow along in the book with an
accompanying Jupyter Notebook that provides interactive examples for
you.

We thank you for your time, and we hope you have found this article
worthy of that time. If you have feedback, if you have found typos,
incorrect statements, important omissions, or if you have suggestions
for improving this document, we'd like to hear from you. Our
