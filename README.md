=====================

This site is the home of “Python for MATLAB Programmers”. It is an introduction 
to numeric Python for programmers who already know MATLAB.

This document was originally produced by [Mike Patterson](https://github.com/mike-patt)
and [Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net), experienced MATLAB coders who have recently adopted Python, too.
